Avida Lineage Viewer
To use the lineage viewer to analyze an Avida detail dump, enter 'python lineageviewer.py -d <detailfile.spop>'.
You can also open the lineage viewer to analyze sub-lineages or edited genomes saved to JSON format by entering 'python lineageviewer.py -j <jsonfile.json>'.
These settings override those found in 'settings.cfg', which can be used to configure the viewer and choose an input file. Settings.cfg contains fields for a detail dump and json file, only one of which should be present at any one time. The unused option can be commented out with the '#' character. It also contains settings for the path to the Avida directory used to analyze genomes, and the tasks that were present in the environment for the run.

Lineages can also be loaded from the viewer GUI, using the file menu to select the appropriate file, which will open in a new window. Sub lineages can be created by selecting a range of genomes and choosing either 'Save Selected' or 'New window from selection' in the file menu.

Genomes can be edited using three methods. 'Edit' changes the currently selected genome only. 'Edit All' changes applies a change to all genomes in the current lineage. 'Edit Selected' applies a change to only the selected genomes. These options can be used to effectively revert or insert mutations into a lineage. Changes made will trigger Avida analyze mode to re-analyze the affected genomes, which may require a short delay.

The options menu allows the user to toggle between absolute and relative fitness color coding. Relative fitness coloring chooses colors on a gradient between green for neutral mutations and blue and red for beneficial and deleterious mutations, respectively. Absolute coloring chooses only completely green, completely blue, or completely red.

The columns menu allows the user to toggle any of the columns in the lineage list view. This can reduce clutter and improve readability.
